## Landing page for Real Estate Startup: [Avondale Capital Parners Ltd.](http://avondalefund.ca){:target="_blank"}

Great project and just the beginning for a new investment fund startup in Calgary, Alberta. Avondale's focus is on medium sized properties in the Prarie provinces, especially supportive right now as the region works hard to keep up during an econonomic hiccup. This team was amazing to work with and I look forward to expanding the page as we go!

## Tech Used

Simple static site put together using Jekyll, HTML/CSS, Jquery and Javascript. Mailchimp signup form used for tracking interested investors and distributing the group's investor deck.

## What's next?

There are some aesthetic fixes coming in the future, as well as expanding the site to include information for current fund members and possibly a crowdfunding app later on!
