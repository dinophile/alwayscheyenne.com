### Welcome to me!

My name is Cheyenne and I rediscovered coding after many years of skirting around the issue. I've been playing around computers since the early 80s and I'm continuously amazed at what wonders this industry gives us! And now I'm a part of it all too!

### I may be a junior but...

I've got big ideas! My first step was completing a coding bootcamp with the amazing people at Bitmaker here in Toronto, and from there I've gone on to join the Ontario Digital Service and continue to learn and level up every day with an awesome team. Although I've mainly learned that I have a lot more to learn, I've made some pretty interesting things and will continue to work on my projects to learn even more!

### I'm always interested in a chat!

If you're ever interested in sharing something cool you've learned or just want to trade Monty Python quotes, I'm happy to listen! I want to expand my skills and confidence in order to work with great people and build even bigger and better things! Always interested in meeting new people and hearing the many different stories in the industry! Feel free to get in touch!
