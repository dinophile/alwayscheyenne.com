### So...

My github is very very new and sparsely populated. It showcases my learning journey for the moment. I will be adding projects that I am working on to showcase my awesomeness!

## Feel free to comment!

I've added a few new secret weapons to my tool belt as I've continued to learn, and hopefully will just keep on adding more! If you see anything I can improve on or know of projects that I could contribute to let me know!
